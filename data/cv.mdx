## Kathy Korevec

### Summary

My background is in engineering, and I've always been a maker. I am highly motivated, intensely curious, and radically passionate about technology. I am interested in helping teams navigate the ever-expanding world of tech, but leveraging it to solve strategic challenges is just half the puzzle. Product innovation is a by-product of cohesive team dynamics and strong leadership. Successful products are second to intelligent teams. I love exploring new ways to build products, and the options are seemingly endless with today's breadth of devices. At work, I love finding new ways to get my hands dirty, exploring new tools, prototyping potential solutions, trying different processes, and kicking-off initiatives. At heart, I'm a geek, engaging with the SF tech community through conferences, meetups, Twitter, etc. I've played a critical role in creating new products, and I am eager to be in a position where I can work to make products successful well beyond launch.


Technology is my life, and I will always be passionate about it. I am grateful to live in the Bay Area, where I am continually surrounded by people who appreciate innovative and progressive technology as much as I do.




### Work Experience

#### Vp of Product at Vercel

Now.

I'm currently at Vercel, where I am the VP of Product. At Vercel, I obsess about improving workflows across the SDLC (software development lifecycle) to help companies Develop, Preview, and Ship. 

Vercel is a fast-growing company and a place where I can embrace my passion for shipping software, connecting with customers, and working to build teams that scale flexibly. Daily, I manage and run the Product team, and I built the Documentation, Research, and Design teams. As a leader, my primary goal is to empower my teams to ship what makes our customers successful. 

#### Senior Director Product Management, GitHub

9/17-7/21

At GitHub, I worked across the entire product and specialized in community, workflow, policy, and documentation. I built the Product Management team and practice in place at the time of the Microsoft acquisition of GitHub. 

Some of my favorite projects:
 - **[Papercuts](https://github.blog/2018-08-28-announcing-paper-cuts/),** a GitHub wide initiative to ship small, high impact fixes and features that improve developer's quality of life. 
 - Establishing a focus on **Enterprise features** to ship key workflows that help large companies scale.
- Leading our approach to handling **US Sanctions regulations**.
- Redefining engagement metrics and **growth strategy**.
- Revamping **GitHub's documentation**.

#### Sr. Product Manager, Heroku

12/15-9/17

At Heroku, I worked directly with the Human Interface Team building the Heroku dashboard, a GUI for the Heroku Toolkit. On this team, I managed the user experience across Heroku products to maintain a consistent workflow that kept developers in the flow. In addition, I was intensely curious about developer collaboration, often pairing with other product managers and engineering teams to build better developer tool experiences across the Heroku and Salesforce Platforms.

#### Sr. Product Manager, Substantial

8/14-12/15

At Substantial, I worked with a team of developers and designers to take product ideas from conception to launch. Along with daily product management tasks like reporting, data analysis, and scrum management, I specialized in refining our communication and process to help tone and client communication. In addition, we employed a deep level of honesty and research for what we do and how we do it. As a result, my team was skilled at successful product launches that continued the products we shipped continued to grow in the real world. 

#### Sr. Product Manager, Disqus

8/12-8/13

At Disqus, I managed the core commenting product, the Disqus Embed. Making and maintaining an established product with hundreds of thousands of users was daunting, but I welcomed it. Often, I dove deep into user experience challenges and partnered with senior leadership, product designers, engineers, sales, and support to cultivate ship what made our customers happy. Daily, we used a combination of user feedback, product design intuition, and data to help us make decisions that result in everything from subtle to blue-sky product launches. 

#### Product Manager, Say Media

8/12-8/13

My work at Say began as the Product Manager for Mobile. My initial focus was to improve and manage the mobile product suite for network advertising. As a result, I was able to scale the mobile product to respond to a marketplace and revenue stream that continues to grow, tripling in my first three months. Over time my focus changed to maintaining a product suite that Say's global studio used to build, traffic, and publish all of our ad units. Additionally, I spearheaded Say's HTML5 strategy and worked to scale their capabilities around dynamic web technologies.

#### Technical Architect, Hot Studio Inc

12/10-8/12

At Hot Studio, I was promoted to collaborate with a cross-disciplinary team to identify product requirements for design, technology, and operations. Defined PRDs, constructed product road maps that pair with business objectives, and wrote/estimated/prioritized stories; maintaining communication and flexibility through the agile product development process was core to my role. In addition, I played a creative role, pairing with engineering to write dynamic proof of concepts which increased my team's productivity and contributed to the success of our products.

#### Technical Strategist, Hot Studio Inc.

12/07-12/10

Engineering begins when the project starts. My promotion to Technical Strategist focused on identifying project requirements for engineering and design related to publishing platforms and frameworks. These requirements informed recommendations for new technologies and instructions regarding how to navigate and build within legacy systems.

#### Web Application Developer, Hot Studio Inc.

12/06-12/07

During my time at Hot as a front-end engineer, I was the sole member of the engineering team, where I quickly learned how to wear many hats. My primary responsibility was both client-side programming for design template support and for prepping CMS integration. Additionally, I often found myself as a lead technical consultant for our UX and Visual Design teams.

#### Web Developer, Google Inc.

7/06-12/06

At Google, I worked with the Google.com front-end engineering team. My focus was on google.com/jobs, where I worked to maintain I18N across our international domains. Through collaboration with Google's global translation and engineering groups, I developed critical communication skills for working with remote teams. Additionally, I worked with the UX team to iteratively update google.com/jobs using end-user test-driven design methodologies.
